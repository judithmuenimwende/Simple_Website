	<p>My name is Judith Mueni.I am currently pursuing Diploma at Akirachix institution and for the past 7months I have been able to design alot of layouts. I have been able to come up with my own logo, I designed it in a way it could represent who exactly I am. <br> <br> Its my own brand and I locate from my logo. I have learned on how to use adobe photoshop, indesign and illustrator. I can design magazine and newspaper through the experience i have received from my graphic design tutor. Believing that by the end of the year I would be able to do alot. <br> I will use all my skills that I have gained in a company I will be employed in. Akirachix has been a good experience for me, it has really taught me alot of new things I never knew before. I am time keeper, I can work with a team, I can work under pressure, I can submit my designs on time. <br> <br>
	I have also learned coding and programmg. I am familiar with some languages like Python, Java,Javascript and Html&Css. Through Html&Css, I have been able to create a portfolio website. Thewebsite contains everything about myself. Through Python and Javascript, I have been able to create a task manager where I keep my tasks and it reminds me of what am supposed to do. </p>
